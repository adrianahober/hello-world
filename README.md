Learning by Doing 

Hi Everyone. I recently made a career switch into the technology realm, specifically cloud solutions. I'm looking to braoden my knowledge by coding and creating various projects - hence learning my doing. I am open to any advice you might wish to share with me on this new path. Thanks in advance!
I look forward to collaborating with you on new projects!
